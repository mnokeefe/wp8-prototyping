# Windows 8 Prototyping tool

## TODO

### Framework

* Make everything more generic
* Support double width panorama panes
* Clickable pivot tab title
* Better use of HTML5 tags (too many divs!)

### Bloom

* Account
* Settings
* Subscriptions, not needed?
* Sharing workflow

### Bugs

* Have to wrap anchor text in a span (or any other tag) to make it clickable in a panorama
* App bar long titles

## App bar

From Microsoft's app bar guidelines:

* Avoid using long text for menu items because the text will run off the screen. The recommended maximum length is between 14 and 20 characters.
* Avoid using more than five menu items on an Application Bar because it will force the user to scroll.
